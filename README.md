## Intro


This is a Node.js library (although mostly vanilla Javascript) to read and parse .meta handling files from GTA V ðŸ¤“

It's primarily intended to be used with Discord bots, such as for building a command that fetches handling data for GTA V vehicles, but it's just standalone Node.js code, not tied to any Discord APIs in itself, so feel free to use it anywhere.

Main features:

  * Reading and parsing data from **multiple .meta files** in a single directory
  * Fetching data in various ways such as **specific properties**, a **simplified summery** of a vehicle, or even properties that are related to certain **keywords** such as "cornering"
  * Decoding `strModelFlags`, `strHandlingFlags`, `strDamageFlags` and even the new `strAdvancedFlags` properties into a list of **human-readable flag names** (by processing them the correct way as bitmasks)
  * Grouping handling properties into **categories** for easy readability
  * Very verbose and easy to use API


## Usage


First of all, **I'm not going to redistribute the game's handling files** on this repository, so you'll have to **source those yourself**.

So let's assume you're setting up a Discord bot command with [Discord.js](http://discord.js.org) to fetch handling data.

First, place *handling.js* next to your main .js file for your bot. Next, make a directory next to it where you'll put all the .meta files from the game.

**IMPORTANT**: Make sure that all of your handling files in the directory follow a naming scheme such as **handling_mpassault.meta**. That is "handling_" followed by the internal name of the DLC it's from, as seen in [OpenIV](http://openiv.com) (or simply "update" in the case of update.rpf), and finally the ".meta" extension.

Next, add some code to your bot, something along these lines *(Of course you should do some more error handling and stuff, this is just a bare bones example)*:

```javascript

const handling = require("./handling"); // Including "handling.js"
const Discord  = require('discord.js');
const client   = new Discord.Client();

client.on('ready', () => {
    console.log(`Logged in as ${client.user.tag}!`);
});

client.on('message', msg => {
    if (msg.content.startsWith("!handling ")) {
        // Getting an array of all arguments
        var args = msgLowercase.substr(10).split(" ");

        // First argument is the vehicle name
        var vehicleName = args[0];

        if (!handling.doesVehicleExist(vehicleName)) {
            /*
             * Vehicle doesn't exist, notify user of it...
             */
            return;
        }

        var vehicleHandling = null; // We'll store the handling data here

        if (args.length > 1) { // If there's more arguments after the vehicle, pass them to the handling library as search terms in a loop

            vehicleHandling = {};

            for (var i=1; i<args.length; i++) { // Looping through the additional arguments
                var tmpHandling = handling.findPropertiesForVehicle(vehicleName, args[i]);
                if (tmpHandling !== null) Object.assign(vehicleHandling, tmpHandling); // Appending results to what we already have, combining the results of all search terms
            }

            if (Object.keys(vehicleHandling).length === 0) {
                /*
                 * Search terms didn't return anything, notify user of it...
                 */
                return;
            }

        } else {
            vehicleHandling = handling.getSimpleHandlingForVehicle(vehicleName); // No arguments after vehicle, get the simple handling summary
        }

        if (vehicleHandling === null) {
            /*
             * No results for some reason, notify user of it...
             */
        } else {
            /*
             * Here you can use the contents of `vehicleHandling` to form a response.
             */
        }
    }
});

// Load the handling files before logging in
console.log("Loading handling files...");
handling.loadFiles("handling_data"); // Tell it the name of the directory containing the files

client.login('token');

```

Here's an example of a Discord command I built into my bot:

Of course it could be used outside of Discord bots too, the core part of it is just vanilla JS. Maybe a web app, anyone?


## Documentation of the API


```javascript
function loadFiles(path, force = false)
```
> **You need to call this once during startup** before calling any other functions from the API. It loads and parses all the handling files from the specified directory.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `path` (string): Path to directory containing the handling files (relative to the script's path).
>
> `force` (optional boolean, default `false`): When `true`, the handling files will be read again, even if they already have been read before.
>
> **Return value**
>
> None. It can throw an `Error()` with a brief description if something goes wrong though.

___

```javascript
function getDlcNameForVehicle(vehicle)
```
> Returns the internal name of the DLC that a vehicle is from. This is based on the names of the handling files, which should follow the naming scheme pointed out earlier.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `vehicle` (string): The internal name of the vehicle. Matching is case-insensitive.
>
> **Return value**
>
> A string with the DLC name, or `null` on error.

___

```javascript
function getCategoryOfProperty(propertyName)
```
> Returns the category of a certain property. This is helpful for better organizing the response message.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `propertyName` (string): The exact name of a property, such as "fMass".
>
> **Return value**
>
> A string with the category name. Returns "Misc" for any properties that don't have a category defined.

___

```javascript
function convertFlagsPropertyToFlagNames(hex, propertyName)
```
> Converts "flag" type properties into human-readable flag names.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `hex` (string): The hexadecimal value of the property (simply as returned with the vehicle's handling data).
>
> `propertyName` (string): The name of the property such as "strHandlingFlags". This determines the table used to decode the flags.
>
> **Return value**
>
> An array of strings that represent the flags, or `null` on error. Unknown flags are represented by their value as a bit-shift expression, such as "(0x1 << 3)".

___

```javascript
function isPropertyConvertableToFlagNames(propertyName)
```
> Tells you if a property is a "flag" type and can be converted into a list of flag names with `convertFlagsPropertyToFlagNames()`, or not.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `propertyName` (string): The exact name of a property, such as "strAdvancedFlags".
>
> **Return value**
>
> Boolean (`true` if property is "flag" type).

___

```javascript
function doesVehicleExist(vehicle)
```
> Tells you if a vehicle exists (has handling data to be fetched), or not.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `vehicle` (string): The internal name of the vehicle. Matching is case-insensitive.
>
> **Return value**
>
> Boolean (`true` if vehicle exists).

___

```javascript
function getHandlingForVehicle(vehicle)
```
> Returns ALL handling data for a certain vehicle.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `vehicle` (string): The internal name of the vehicle. Matching is case-insensitive.
>
> **Return value**
>
> Object (see structure in the [next section](#object-structure-of-handling-data)), or `null` on error.

___

```javascript
function getSimpleHandlingForVehicle(vehicle)
```
> Returns a simplified version of the handling data for a vehicle, containing only the most relevant properties.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `vehicle` (string): The internal name of the vehicle. Matching is case-insensitive.
>
> **Return value**
>
> Object (see structure in the [next section](#object-structure-of-handling-data)), or `null` on error.

___

```javascript
function getPropertyForVehicle(vehicle, property)
```
> Returns one specific handling property of a vehicle.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `vehicle` (string): The internal name of the vehicle. Matching is case-insensitive.
>
> `property` (string): The exact name of the property, such as "fMass". It has to be an exact match, otherwise the function fails.
>
> **Return value**
>
> Object (see structure in the [next section](#object-structure-of-handling-data)), or `null` on error.

___

```javascript
function findPropertiesForVehicle(vehicle, propertySearch)
```
> Returns one or more properties of a vehicle that match the search term in some way. The returned properties will either have the search term occur in their names (e.g. "driveforce" would return "fInitialDriveForce"), or if the search term is one of the pre-defined keywords (such as "cornering"), then all properties assigned to this keyword will be returned. Check the source code for the keywords and the properties they return.
>
> **Arguments**
>
> `vehicle` (string): The internal name of the vehicle. Matching is case-insensitive.
>
> `propertySearch` (string): The search term to be used for matching property names or keywords. Matching is case-insensitive.
>
> **Return value**
>
> Object (see structure in the [next section](#object-structure-of-handling-data)), or `null` on error.


## Object structure of handling data


The structure of objects that hold handling data (e.g. as returned by `findPropertiesForVehicle()`) is pretty simple. For the most part, it's just a **flat object with property names** as keys, and their values as values obviously. They are **not grouped** into any sub-objects or anything (regardless if the property is inside "SubHandlingData" in the original file for example), with one exception, which are 3-component vectors (properties that start with "vec"). These are just objects with `x`, `y` and `z` floating point components.

Here's an example object with one property of each possible data type, represented as JSON here:

```json
{
    "vecInertiaMultiplier": {
        "x": 1,
        "y": 1.6,
        "z": 1.7
    },
    "fInitialDriveForce": 0.36,
    "nInitialDriveGears": 6,
    "strHandlingFlags": "20002"
}
```

Notice that "handlingName" is not returned, so keep track of the vehicle name separately.
